Hello class

My name is Francesca Johnson. I like to analyze data and build mobile applications. I am most familiar with C, C#, Java, Swift, SQL, and various scripts. Currently I work on the ORION Project with Honeywell, this started out as an internship and turned into a longterm application consultant position.
